The incidence of new organ failures during the study was similar in the two groups. We observed slightly higher average SOFA subscores for liver and coagulation in the albumin group, indicating a higher serum bilirubin and a lower platelet count, respectively, than were observed in the crystalloid group. Nonetheless, the absolute excess in the serum bilirubin concentration in the albumin group was marginal (median, 1.0 mg per deciliter [interquartile range, 0.6 to 1.7] vs. 0.9 mg per deciliter [interquartile range, 0.5 to 1.5], P<0.001) and was probably related to the methods used to prepare albumin solutions, which may be inefficient in clearing bilirubin content from plasma.21,27 The slight reduction in platelet counts in the'), ('ALBIOS.txt', ' bilirubin content from plasma.21,27 The slight reduction in platelet counts in the albumin group may be a further marker of a larger expansion of the intravascular compartment in this group than in the crystalloid group, with a consequent dilution of the hemoglobin content (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).'), ('ALBIOS.txt', 'Post hoc univariate and multivariate analyses of data from the 1121 patients with septic shock showed significantly lower mortality at 90 days in the albumin group than in the crystalloid group. Conversely, in the subgroup of patients with severe sepsis without shock, mortality appeared to be higher among those who were treated with albumin than among those treated with crystalloids alone, although the difference was far from significant. This analysis was not prespecified, and therefore it may be characterized by well-known biases. Nonetheless, a state of shock associated with severe sepsis represents a well-defined clinical entity.

Additionally, some studies have found no significant differences in 28-day or in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, or duration of organ support between the EGDt group and usual care.\n",
      "\n",
      "The controversy surrounding EGDt centers around its high adherence to algorithm-directed therapies, but also concerns about potential risks associated with individual elements of the treatment protocol. Some critics have argued that the aggressive use of vasopressors in particular may increase mortality rates or cause unnecessary harm.\n",

      "Despite these controversies, some studies have suggested that bundle-based care, which includes EGDt as part of a broader package of evidence-based treatments, may be more effective than usual care in reducing mortality rates and improving outcomes for patients with sepsis. As such, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now recommend incorporating elements of the 6-hour resuscitation bundle into sepsis treatment protocols.\n",
